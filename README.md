## Capabilities of MDPS
MDPS is maser data processing suite, with user friendly GUI. Currently it allows users to perform:

- Process SDR output
- Display monitoring  
- Visualize data for publications and presentation 

## Dependencies
- python 3
  - PyQt5 5.14.0 
  - Astropy 4.0.1.
  - coloredlogs 14.0
  - Matplotlib 3.2.1 
  - Numpy 1.18.2
  - H5py 2.10.0 
  - ExperimentsLogReader 2.2.2
  - SciPy 1.4.1
  - PeakUtils 1.3.3
  - pandas 1.0.3 
  - mplcursors 0.3
  - jplephem 2.14
  - configparser 5.0.0
  
## Processing SDR output
SDR for each scan creates four files **r0** **r1** **s0** **s1**. File name is &lt;source&gt; __f&lt;frequency&gt; _&lt; &lt;station label&gt; _&lt;iteration&gt; _no&lt;scan number&gt;&lt;r0, r1, s0, s1&gt;.dat file type is ASCII. 
Script sdr_fs.py us frequency shifting algorithm described by publication ... It creates output file with name  &lt;source&gt; _&lt;Day&gt; _&lt;Month&gt; _&lt;Year&gt; _&lt;Hour&gt; :&lt;Minute&gt; :&lt;Seconde&gt; _&lt;station name&gt; _&lt;iteration&gt;.h5 that file, has hdf5 format. With table amplitude, that have colons velocity, amplitude for left and right polarization. 

Script sdr_fs.py it average all scans, smooth data and create output for monitoring. It append sdr_fs.py output with these tables amplitude_corrected, amplitude_corrected_not_smooht.
Script sdr_fs.py have these: source, line, iteration_number and log_file mandatory parameters. Parameter source is observed source, line is observed frequency, iteration_number is observation iteration number and parameter log_file is log file generated by SDR.

The sdr_fs.py script can be run with additional options:

-v or --version to display current version

-h or --help for help

-c or --config to point to configuration file. Default path is: config/config.cfg


Script total_spectrum_analyzer_qt5.py have mandatory parameters datafile and line. Parameter datafile is output of script sdr_fs.py. Parameter line is observed frequency. 

The total_spectrum_analyzer_qt5.py script can be run with additional options:

-v or --version to display current version

-h or --help for help

-c or --config to point to configuration file. Default path is: config/config.cfg

-r or --rawdata data will not be smoothed 

-t or --calibType Type of calibration SDR od DBBC. Default is SDR. 

-tr or --threshold threshold for outlier filter
           
-f or --filter Set the amount of times to filter data to remove noise spikes [0 - 10]. Default is 0.


The main.py script have source and line mandatory parameters. 
The main.py script can be run with additional options:

-v or --version to display current version

-h or --help for help

-c or --config to point to configuration file. Default path is: config/config.cfg



| **Scripts** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| main.py | Automatically call sdr_fs.py and total_spectrum_analyzer_qt5.py |
| sdr_fs.py | Process four output files from SDR |
| total_spectrum_analyzer_qt5.py | Process sdr_fs.py output|

## Changelog

## Getting Help

Bug reports, feature requests and make contributions (e.g. code patches) can be reported by opening a &quot;new issue&quot; ticket on GitHub. Please give as much information (e.g. the software component, version) as you can in the ticket. For bugs, it is extremely useful if a small self-contained code snippet that reproduces the problem is provided.
